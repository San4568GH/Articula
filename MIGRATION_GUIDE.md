# 📸 Image Migration to Cloudinary

This guide will help you migrate all existing local images from your `/uploads` folder to Cloudinary cloud storage.

## 🎯 What This Migration Does

1. **Scans** all posts in your database that have cover images
2. **Uploads** local images to Cloudinary in the "Articula" folder
3. **Updates** post records to use Cloudinary URLs instead of local paths
4. **Preserves** original local files (for safety)
5. **Generates** a detailed migration report

## 🚀 Pre-Migration Checklist

- ✅ Cloudinary credentials are set in `/api/.env`
- ✅ MongoDB connection is working
- ✅ Backend server can connect to Cloudinary
- ✅ You have a database backup (recommended)
- ✅ All existing posts are accessible

## 📋 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Verify Your Setup

First, test that everything is working by creating a new post with an image to ensure Cloudinary is properly configured.

### Step 2: Run the Migration

Navigate to your project root and run:

```bash
npm run migrate:images
```

Or directly:

```bash
node api/run-migration.js
```

### Step 3: Monitor the Process

The migration will show real-time progress:

```

📁 Found 12 images in uploads folder

[1/15] Processing post: "My First Blog Post"
📤 Uploading image for post: "My First Blog Post"
✅ Successfully migrated: "My First Blog Post"
   📁 Local: uploads/abc123.jpg
   ☁️  Cloud: https://res.cloudinary.com/dervixjwy/image/upload/v1234567890/Articula/my_first_post_1234567890.jpg

```

### Step 4: Review Migration Report

After completion, check the generated `migration-report.json`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-08T10:30:00.000Z",
  "stats": {
    "total": 15,
    "migrated": 12,
    "skipped": 2,
    "errors": 1
  },
  "details": [
    {
      "postId": "66e123...",
      "title": "My First Blog Post",
      "status": "migrated",
      "oldPath": "uploads/abc123.jpg",
      "newUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dervixjwy/..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔄 Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, you can rollback the migration:

```bash
npm run migrate:rollback
```

This will restore all post cover fields to their original local paths.

## 🎉 Post-Migration Cleanup

After verifying everything works correctly:

### 1. Test Your Website
- Browse all posts with images
- Check that images load correctly
- Verify edit functionality works

### 2. Optional Cleanup (After Verification)
```bash
# Remove local uploads folder (optional)
rm -rf api/uploads

# Remove static file serving from server.js (already done)
# The line: app.use('/uploads', express.static(...)) has been removed
```

### 3. Update .gitignore
Add to your `.gitignore`:
```
api/uploads/
api/migration-report.json
```

## 📊 Migration Features

### ✅ What Gets Migrated

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "File not found" errors**
- Some posts reference images that no longer exist locally
- These will be logged as errors but won't stop the migration

**2. Cloudinary upload failures**
- Check your Cloudinary credentials
- Verify internet connection
- Check Cloudinary account limits

**3. Database connection issues**
- Verify MONGO_URI in .env file
- Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows connections

### Getting Help

Check the migration report for detailed information about any issues. The script provides verbose logging to help identify problems.

## 🎯 Expected Results
